## About

This course covers a number of introductory topics related to Bash (the Bourne
Again SHell) and the Linux shell. This course is not meant to be exhaustive in
its coverage of all topics nor in its coverage of any of the given topics, but
rather attempts to provide the basic information for novice users to become
moderately proficient at navigating the shell and performing basic tasks
efficiently through the command line and scripting.

All the best,

\- Joe
