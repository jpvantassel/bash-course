## About

This course covers a number of introductory topics related to the Bourne
Again SHell (Bash). This course does not claim to be exhaustive in
its coverage of topics related to Bash nor does it assert that its coverage
on any particular topic is exhaustive. Rather, this course's purpose is to
provide basic information to novice users, such that they can become moderately
proficient at navigating the Bash shell.

All the best,

\- Joe
